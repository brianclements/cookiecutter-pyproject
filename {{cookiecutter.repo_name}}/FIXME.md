# Fixme
This file is an informal collection of items to improve in the codebase meant
for the internal use of the maintainers. They are items that are:

* Either too trivial or not user-facing enough to be GitHub issues
* Too general or unrefined to be in the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) file
* Miscellaneous items that have yet to be sorted
